# YanCheng
The code of the TianChi Yancheng data competition.
We got the 7th place as a team of"QinQiShuHua",Thank you so much to my teammate Qi,an unforgettable experience for 
This is my code part.
I did not sort out the code cause I am kind of lazy to do this stuff.
The code : part0220.py and partewm3.py is the model for preliminary contest.
The code :EDAtrain.ipython is the EDA  for preliminary contest.
The code: model1 is the model for Rematch.
The code: result的趋势，result趋势，train趋势分析 is the EDA for Rematch.
excepet for the model1.py,the part0220.py and partewm3.py is not the final model for submission.I did some optimization。But I didn't remark which is the final model for submit.
